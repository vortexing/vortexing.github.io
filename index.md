### About Me
I'm a biomedical engineer, turned molecular biologist, turned data scientist at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center.  Along that road I've studied the [role of genetic and functional heterogeneity in cancer](/research) from many angles.  I enjoy the intersections between the data we generate,  the technology and tools we apply to them, and the analyses that give us insight into the mechanisms of human disease. This interest has also lead to a variety of [data intensive, collaborative and consulting projects](/projects).


Outside of work I'm a hobby potter, a sucker for a rescue dog, and trying to thoughtfully pick up the things I had to drop when the pandemic started.  I offer up my time doing informal science education with kids, coaching youth sports (volleyball, soccer and Girls on the Run), and digging in to problems around me by delivering groceries for the [Ballard Food Bank](https://www.ballardfoodbank.org/), or building Tiny Homes with middle schoolers for [LIHI](https://www.lihihousing.org/).  

I'm always on the lookout for something I haven't yet done, science or otherwise. If you'd like to meet up and chat, [use this link to schedule something.](https://calendly.com/amypag/chat)
