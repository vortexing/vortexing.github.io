### About Me
Iâ€™m a biomedical engineer turned molecular biologist turned data scientist with over 15 years of experience spanning wet bench to computational discovery in cancer research. Currently, I co-lead the Fred Hutch Cancer Center [Office of the Chief Data Officer](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/) and our outreach and collaborative efforts via the [Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/).  My main focus is building an institutional scale data governance framework, developing scalable data products and translational data infrastructure in alignment with an overall data strategy, and developing a new department while fostering a collaborative, open and forward looking data culture.


#### Data Strategy
As a leader, I believe the future of progress in understanding human health happens at the intersections of disciplines. I enjoy working with diverse teams to design innovative solutions, at a range of scales - from developing institutional-level data strategy and data governance to developing the human and technological infrastructure for building and scaling data science and AI applications to clinical and research problems. Developing truly effective cross-functional partnerships and collaborations is key to making democratized, scalable data solutions sustainable and impactful.  I've found the adage that culture eats strategy for breakfast is perhaps most true in the rapidly evolving data and technology arena and delivering advances in this area requires a dual technical and cultural vision and the commitment to making change in both areas.

#### Cancer Research
As a research scientist, I have always found myself in the intersections between the data we generate, the technology and tools we apply to them, and the analyses that give us insight into the mechanisms of human disease. My [research specialties](/research) include genomic data integration, single-cell and bulk sequencing analysis, cloud-based bioinformatics, and regulatorily-compliant data management. 



#### Human
Outside of work I'm a hobby potter, a sucker for a rescue dog, and enjoy my evolving relationship contributing to my local community.  I offer up my time doing informal science education with kids, coaching youth sports (volleyball, soccer and Girls on the Run), and digging in to problems around me such as delivering groceries for the [Ballard Food Bank](https://www.ballardfoodbank.org/), or building Tiny Homes with middle schoolers for [LIHI](https://www.lihihousing.org/).  



### Contact
I'm always on the lookout for something I haven't yet done, science, strategy or otherwise. If you'd like to meet up and chat, [use this link to schedule something](https://calendly.com/amypag/chat) or drop me an [email](mailto:amy.tdlr+public@gmail.com).
