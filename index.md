During my time as a postdoc and as an independently funded Staff Scientist in Dr. Jerald Radich's laboratory at the Fred Hutch, I've been focused on development of novel assay techniques at the single cell level and beyond.  Since my days working at a flow cytometry startup as an undergrad, I've been interested in the tales single cells and their variability can tell us about human disease.  

This lead me through developing assays of protein activation/phosphorylation *in situ* in microfluidic devices as a graduate student, targeted genetic and gene expression assays as a postdoc, and the connection of genetic mutations with transcriptional signatures at the single cell level in leukemia as a Staff Scientist.  Being able to combine my background in engineering and the biology of cancer has created a variety of opportunities for me to think critically about how we leverage novel technologies for truly translational research projects. 

>Methods development work can diverge wildly from the environs where those types of assays might be applied in the course of patient care.  While exploring novel tech can be really inspiring, the hook for me has always been how we might be able to translate it to the clinic for it to really mean something.
