## Fred Hutch SciWiki
One way in which I've shared what I've learned over the years is via a handful of community oriented efforts.  One of which is that I lead the [Fred Hutch Biomedical Data Science Wiki](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/) project, a collaborative documentation and training effort.

The SciWiki project aims to create a curated collection of Fred Hutch oriented documentation regarding policies, resources and tools available to our researchers supporting the generation, analysis and sharing of research data. I coordinate the project and previously supported the Wiki Writer/Editor program at the Fred Hutch. 



## Fred Hutch Data Science Research Community Slack
I administer a Slack workspace [here](https://fhdata.slack.com) that supports peer to peer support for researchers at the Hutch, UW, and local institutions working in data intensive areas.
